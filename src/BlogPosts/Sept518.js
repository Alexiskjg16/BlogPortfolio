                <header className="AllBlogHeaders"> Being The Only Girl:: </header>
                <p className="AllBlogBodies"> A brief post on some views and experiences. Growing up as a millennial in a white middle-class family, I have never felt like a minority or had any issues with my gender. I went
                    to a small private high school that was equally distributed and kept in check; upon entering the workforce I slowly became desensitized to the comments and jokes thrown my way by
                    men. Especially in the service industry, being sexually harassed by coworkers is as expected as having a cook that is under the influence 80% of the time. From making comments
                    about my physical appearance ‘damn girl you look hott today!’ to straight questions like ‘how big are your breasts?’ or ‘how flexible are you?’ I quickly learned to just shrug it
                    off and put up with it, because ‘it was harmless and they’re just men.’
                    When I took the step forward to SunCoast Developers Guild, and into a more professional work setting, I thought “here’s my chance”. I can get a new start, expect more of the males that I am around,
                    hold myself to a higher standard, and stand up for myself when necessary without fear of being the one looked down on. And then…. I walked into my classroom for the next 12 weeks. A male instructor
                    at the front of the class. Nine other men as students in the course. And me, the only female. Needless to say, I was nervous. Fast forward six weeks, and these men have shown me a great introduction
                    into the professional work setting. Yes there have been a few times when they think I’m not around and they make inappropriate jokes (though never directed towards anyone) and I have had to step
                    forward and tell them to hush. But they take that in stride and respectfully dial it back. I have even had them personally approach me and insist I tell them if they cross a line, before it ever has
                    a chance to get bad. And being that we are around each other 9 hours a day, 5 days a week, we have formed into a sort of family. I go from the mother hen (me:“Have you ate yet today?”) to the little
                    sister (them:“Do we need to kick someones a$$ for you?”).Coming from someone that has had many a bad experience with men, both personally and in the workplace, I had not expected to have such a good
                    experience here, even before I saw the statistics. I came in full walls up, in fight mode to defend my femininity. But I am slowly relaxing and recognizing that men CAN be respectful adults, if you
                    hold them up to that standard. I realize that still not everyone is the same, and I have been very lucky in my exposure to these gentlemen, but it came at a perfect time in my life that I needed that
                    faith restored. I can only hope my future endeavours are as fruitful, and a huge shoutout to my Cohort-X! </p>
