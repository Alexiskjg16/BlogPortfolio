                <p className="AllBlogBodies">One full week has passed since I graduated from Suncoast Developers Guild.
                 And where am I today? Back in their main room, on my laptop. This past week I have taken several days to
                relax, several days to work at my previous job (waitressing) and still several days to job hunt. It is so 
                strange to be thrown out to my own devices after spending 12 weeks at school; I am trying to keep up a 
                rhythm and not let myself fall behind. That being said, if you look at my Github, my code chart is pretty 
                bare for last week. One of the major things the instructors pressed on us was to keep coding after we left, 
                make sure we keep it up so potential employers see we’re still coding! But without a daily assignment to 
                complete, that task is a lot more difficult than it sounds. I’ve made several small changes to my portfolio 
                or other codes, and have a few leads on some freelance, but finding motivation is hard. Once again shoutout 
                to the staff at SDG for letting me come hang out and bug them, that’s helping me keep coming back!
                  Over this past week I feel like I’ve learned a lot about self-motivation and organization — there’s no 
                teacher there to give me a daily assignment and a due date. I’ve learned to sell myself a little more in 
                conversation — I’m no longer a student leaning on the shoulders of my school, I’m an independent full-stack 
                developer looking for a job! But I can still see a difference in myself from 12 weeks ago, in how I talk to 
                myself, and how much easier it is for me to ‘do the thing’. I feel confident, qualified. Even though I 
                don’t yet have a job, I still am so proud that I went and completed this course, and I’m still discovering 
                just how much I learned from it outside of just ‘this.state.props’.
                 Also today, a new cohort started at SDG. I’m doing my best to be here for them as much as I can, since I 
                know just what that’s like and community support is #1. Without the support I had(and am still getting!) 
                I would not have succeeded as much as I have. I’m so happy I get the chance while I’m still here to be 
                able to be an extra rubber duck to these students.
                 All I ask is for good thoughts and vibes from ya’ll as I keep plugging away! Hopefully more updates come
                soon :) </p>
